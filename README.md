# Smart Drone Network

### Step -I (Network Design)

 - Node types: Pickup and unload stations, Charging stations
 - Drones: Random Walkers (taking stuffs from node to node, may need charging some time)
 - Charging station : Special nodes with limited capacity of charge
 - Delevary challange: Findout the shortest and efficient path for delevary
  
### Step - II (Network Simulation and test)

- Simulation
- Create Online streaming od data with Spark (Delta Lake, MLFlow)
- Track the drone in data dashboard realtime 
- Localization, Sensor fusion, Path selection

### Step- III (Hardware Integration)

- Integration with ROS system
- IOT implementation with graphical database
- Network Implementation and test
